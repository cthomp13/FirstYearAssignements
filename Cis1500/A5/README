***Compilation***
Open the LXTerminal
Use the change directory command "cd" until you are in folder where the a5.c file is held
type in "gcc -ansi -Wall a5.c -o Lottery"
Now the code in a5.c has been compiled into a file named Lottery.
To run the program type in "./Lottery"

*****Running the program(s)******

First the program will ask you for your name. You may enter anything at this point.
Next the program will ask how much money is able to be won, you must enter a number (decimal is optional).
The program will then present a menu. You have 4 options: enter the winning ticket, enter your ticket, 
check to see if your ticket has won anything, or quit.
If you choose to enter the winning ticket or your ticket, you will be asked to enter 6 numbers one at a time.
These must be numbers between 01 and 49. Numbers below ten must be in the form of 01, 02, etc.
After entering a winning ticket and your ticket, you will be able to check if your ticket has won anything.
The program will compare your ticket to the winning ticket looking for matches and will tell 
you how much money you have won.
if you choose to quit, the program will end.

***Known Limitations***

You are only able to quit from the main menu.

The program will not handle input for the menu that is longer than 101 characters. 

****Testing******

Here I will show the testing and results I got with each point where the program takes the user's input.
This is in order to make sure my userProofing is effective in covering every kind of input.

I am skipping the input for their name since the user may input anything.
