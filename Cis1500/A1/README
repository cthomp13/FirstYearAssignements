Open the LXTerminal
Use the change directory command "cd" until you are in folder where the a1.c file is held
type in "gcc a1.c -o BMI"
Now the code in a1.c has been compiled into a file named BMI
To run the program type in "./BMI"

***Purpose***

The purpose of this program is to calculate BMI based on height and weight.

***How to Use the Program "a1"***

When you run the program it will ask for you to input your height.
Type in a NUMBER that is your height in inches.

Next the program will ask for your weight.
Type in a NUMBER that is your weight in pounds.

The program will take these two values and calculate your BMI.

The program will then print out on the screen: The height you gave it, the weight you gave it, and the calculated BMI.

***Limitations of the Program***
The program will not work as intended based on certain input. 

The program will "break" if the input falls into one of the following categories:

	The input is not numeric

	The input is outside the range of numbers that a "float" can hold
