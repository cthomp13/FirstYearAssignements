***Compilation***
Open the LXTerminal
Use the change directory command "cd" until you are in folder where the A3.c file is held
type in "gcc -ansi -Wall A3.c -o HiLo"
Now the code in A3.c has been compiled into a file named HiLo.
To run the program type in "./HiLo"

***Purpose***

The purpose of this program is to play a high low game. The computer randomly selects a card,
and the user then guesses if the next card will of higher or lower value.

***How to Use the Program "A3"***

When you start the program, it will display what the current card is.
It will also ask you if the next card will be higher, lower, or if you wish to quit.

You need to enter a "1", "2", or a "0" as input to the program. 
If you type "1" or "2", the game will continue.

The program will then tell you the value of the next selected card and whether you guessed correctly
if the card would be higher or lower. (If the card is the same it tells you that and does not change the score)

It then tells you what your current score is and also what the current card is. 

The next line asks you whether the next card will be higher or lower, or if you wish to quit. 
This is the beginning of the next round.

The program will continue to repeat those steps until you type 0 and the game quits.
It will then print out your final score and stop the program. 

***Limitations of the Program***
The program will not work as intended based on certain input. 

If the input when ask for a 1, 2, or 0 is longer than 19 characters, the program will still work
but will not look as intended.

The program will not work as intended if when asked for input, the user enters a number outside the range of a float.
