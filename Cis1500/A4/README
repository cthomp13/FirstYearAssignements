***Compilation***
Open the LXTerminal
Use the change directory command "cd" until you are in folder where the a4.c file is held
type in "gcc -ansi -Wall a4.c -o Flashcards"
Now the code in a4.c has been compiled into a file named Flashcards.
To run the program type in "./Flashcards"

*****Running the program(s)******

To begin wih you will be presented with a menu. If you wish to do addition flashcards type "a" then press enter.
If you wish to do multiplication flashards type "m" then press enter. If you wish to quit type "q" then press enter.
If you wish to view the high score list type "h" then press enter. 
If you choose to do the addition or multiplication flashcards, first you will be asked how many rounds you wish to play.
After that you will be presented with a question one at a time. It will ask for a response, if you give 
the correct answer you will recieve a point. After the number of rounds you hose to play, it will tell you your total 
score and you an return to the main menu by pressing any key and then enter. You may also quit at any time during
the program by typing "q" and enter.

***Known Limitations***

You are not able to quit when you are asked how many rounds you wish to play.

The program will not handle input for the menu that is longer than 102 characters. 

***** Above and Beyond*****

I have added the ability to record how long one set of rounds took the user, it will also tell the user this number in seconds.

Using the amount of seconds,  then constructed a high score list. This was made on the basis of file reading and writing.
By storing a few strings and integers I could modify and display the highscore list while using the program. More detail
on how i did this is in the comments of the code.
