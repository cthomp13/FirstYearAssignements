***Compilation****
Open the LXTerminal
Use the change directory command "cd" until you are in the A3 folder.
type in make
type ./bin/dungeonMaster

****Instructions****
Once you are in the dungeon you may use the following keys for movement:
w for up
a for left
s for down
d for right.
typing q will quit the game after printing your inventory.

You can't walk on/through walls or monsters.
You can pick up items.
Stairs are out of order.

******Character Set******
B is a bat/monster.
% is stairs.
* is gold.
! is a potion.
) is a weapon.
- is a wall.
| is also a wall.
+ is a door.
. Is an empty floor tile.

******Other Information******
Items picked up will be added to the inventory. Inventory is shown when you quit.
If you try to move into the void you will not be able to.

******Limitations****************
If you have the window small enough compared to the width of the dungeon,
then the inventory will overwrite onto the dungeon map and break the game.
SOLUTION: run the game again but this time inside a bigger window.

If the dungeon that is drawn extends past the edge of the screen then when you 
maximize the window the dungeon will stay cut off on the bottom/side of the screen.
SOLUTION: Rerun the program in a larger window.

Since the seeding of the function rand only occurs once per second, and the program
operates at much faster speeds, this usually leads to a lack of randomized. This tends
to have multiple monsters of the same type and multiple monsters moving in the same 
direction.
